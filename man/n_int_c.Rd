\title{Commutative Intensity Neighbor Index}
\usage{
n_int_c(without, with_nbs)
}
\arguments{
\item{without}{a vector containing non-negatives real values.}

\item{with_nbs}{a vector containing non-negatives real values. 

with_nbs contains the performance of individuals with a neighbor.
without contains the performance of individual without a neighbor.}
}
\value{
a vector containing the index values.
}
\description{
Commutative Intensity Neighbor Index
}
\details{
This function computes the Commutative Intensity Neighbor Index developed by
DÃ¬az-Sierra et al. (2016). Positive values indicates a positive net effect of
the neighbor (facilitation) whereas negative values indicates a negative one
(competition).
